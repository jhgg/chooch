# chooch - An Amazing Project

Downloads files fast (in theory).

You shouldn't use this, it's not robust and it will probably corrupt your files. It's also pretty-bad-codeâ„¢.

It was created in haste in attempt to download large files from servers across the internet, where single TCP streams are probably slower than many.

```bash
chooch [URL] [OUTPUT_PATH]
```

PRs welcome :)
